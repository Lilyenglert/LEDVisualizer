# LEDVisualizer
### An Interactive Music Visualizer with Arduino
Lily Croskey-Englert, Nikki Bregman, Andrew Zee. 

#### Project Description

Dev note: The final code is in IR_attempt directory.
#### Roles

#### Tools & Materials
Code: Arduino was used for this project. The libraries we used include the NeoPixel GFX & Neopixel Matrix libraries for lights, and ArduinoFFT for frequncy calculation. All other code was written by us. 
Printing & Laser Cutting: Fusion 360 & illustrator for producing models.
Interaction Design: Framer X was used for interaction design concepts. 


#### Process
We used a rapid prototyping methodology for this project. We started by ideating and developing the concept and then moved to the initial design of the display. We created three iterations of the design to land on the final project implementation. The first iteration was a cardboard prototype to illustrate the feasibilty of the design specification. For the second prototype we separated the major design componants and focused on individiual functionality. In the final prototype we integrated the componants. 

##### Concept Development
From the start we knew we wanted to create a type of light display, given the backgrounds of our team members and the time constraint. ?We had to decide what kind of input the display would react to and how it would react.?

..To do this we needed to understand where and how the display should be used.
